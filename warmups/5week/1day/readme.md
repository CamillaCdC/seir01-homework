# Simple Sums - Ruby

Write a program that can calculate the sum of the first n elements of the following sequences:

```ruby
s1 = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1
s2 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + //etc
```

For example:

```ruby
s1(4) = 0
s2(4) = 10
```

Can you guess what the sum would be if n is infinity?

## Bonus

Write a JavaScript program to find the length of the longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer, in the range of 0 to the passed in integer. Integer must be positive.
