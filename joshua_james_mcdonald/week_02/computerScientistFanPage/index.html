                </h2>
                <p> Computer science led to Quantum computing with the help of Paul Benioff, who is also known as
                    'The father of quantum computation', due to his work on showing that QC (quantum computing) was
                    indeed feasible.

                <p>
                    Paul A. Benioff is an American physicist who helped pioneer the field of quantum computing. <br>
                    Benioff is best known for his research in quantum information theory during the 1970s and 80s
                    that demonstrated the theoretical possibility of quantum computers by describing the first quantum
                    mechanical model of a computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this work, Benioff showed that a computer could operate under the
                    laws of quantum mechanics by describing a Schr√∂dinger equation description of Turing machines. <br>
                    Benioff's body of work in quantum information theory has continued on to the present day and has
                    encompassed quantum computers, quantum robots, and the relationship between foundations in logic,
                    math, and physics.

                    Quantum Computing </h2>
                <p>
                    In the 1970s, Benioff began to research the theoretical feasibility of quantum computing.
                    His early research culminated in a paper,[3] published in 1980, that described a quantum
                    mechanical model of Turing Machines. This work was based on a classical description in 1973
                    of reversible Turing machines by physicist Charles H. Bennett. </p>
