    <h2>The Analytical Machine</h2>

    <p id ="tight">The Analytical Machine was a machine proposed by Charles Babbage a friend and colleague of Lovelace's. It was to be a general purpose automatic mechanical machine able to perform calculations. It comprised of the mill, the store, the reader, and the printer which are analogous with the components required for computers today. The mill similar to a CPU, the store held data in place of a hardrive and the reader and printer were the input and output of the machine.</p>

    <p id="moveRight">Her mother's obsession with rooting out her father's insanity as she put it lead to Ada being taught mathematics at an early age and she later was considered a prodigy in the subject. Her list of tutors included William Frend, William King, Mary Somerville and later Augustus De Morgan.
    Through becoming close friends with her tutor Mary Somerville she was introduced to Charles Babbage in 1833. Ada Lovelace worked with Babbage on his pre-computer and as part of a publication of his work she added extensive notes beyond in scope and size of the originals. In these notes she identified that the machine could be used for more than simple calculations as originally intended. Within these notes she created an algorithm for the machine that is considered to be the first computer program.</p>
    <p id="quote">"I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in one shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar."</p>
