    <h2>Trivia</h2>


    <p>At 12 years old Ada decided that she wanted to fly. She methodically researched the anatomy of bird wings to determine the necessary size and structure also considering the potential materials to use for such a project. In her pursuit she even decided to write a book named Flyology for her findings complete with illustrations. Babbage later nicknamed her "Lady Fairy".</p>
