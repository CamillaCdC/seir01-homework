      <h2>Interesting Frances Facts, "Fracts"</h2>

      <p>Allen has traveled internationally not only to give lectures about compilers, but also for athletic pursuits: she is a veteran of many mountain-climbing expeditions in Austria, China, Tibet, and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>She joined IBM on July 15, 1957, exactly two months after the FORTRAN programming language had been released. Her first assignment was to teach research scientists within IBM how to use this language and indirectly encourage IBM customers to use it. She did what teachers often must: she learned the subject matter just a few days ahead of her students.</p>
      <p>She spent the majority half of her career developing cutting-edge programming language compilers for IBM Research. Including her first major project was for the Stretch/Harvest computer. Stretch was one of the first supercomputers, and Harvest was a coprocessor for Stretch that had been designed for the US National Security Agency (NSA) to do codebreaking of secret messages.</p>
